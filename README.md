  Perhaps, if we had the data for it, you could break this down by party as well. We have the total voter turnout data already, we could also look at how the data          breaks down on party lines if we had the data. Secondly, you could modify this formula and have it encompass a larger dataset. Namely, a general election. Instead of   counties, it would be states or whatever unit you would like to use.
